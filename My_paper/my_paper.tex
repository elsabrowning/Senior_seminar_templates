\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	 We will describe the history of automating algorithm design (AAD) with a focus on hyper-heuristics (HH) optimization. We will go over a few different genetic programming variants used in HH and the success of two in particular. Finally, we will go over current research being done with stack-based genetic programming (one of the GP variants); the stack-based programming language called Push is used in this example along with a technique for AAD called autoconstruction.

\section{Autoconstruction}
\label{sec:ac}

Traditionally, genetic programming solutions to problems evolve, but almost everything else is specified by the system designer \cite{spector:2016}. In autoconstruction, the variation methods are evolving as well. Spector et al. generalizes how this is happening:
\begin{quotation}
	In autoconstructive evolution the methods for variation are encoded in the same individuals that are being evolved as solutions to the target problem \cite{spector:2016}.
\end{quotation}
Here,``individuals" refers to programs. This means that the methods for evolution are evolving, too. These are things like mutation and crossover--things that cause variation in the population (see Section \ref{sec:evocomp} and Section \ref{sec:GP} for more details on how these work).

Prior work on autoconstruction has explored a variety of system designs, but, until recently, none of them have been able to solve hard problems. This new system called Autoconstructive Diversification of Genomes (AutoDoG) has managed to solve a hard problem: "Replace Space with Newline" \cite{spector:2016}. And, in recent unpublished work, AutoDoG has actually solved a problem that has never been solved before \cite{Eva:autoconstruction}.

In Section \ref{sec:push}, we will describe the format in which AutoDoG is expressed. In Section \ref{sec:autodog} we will describe how AutoDoG works. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:results} we will go over how well AutoDoG performs compared to other systems.

\subsection{Push and Plush}
\label{sec:push}

Push is a programming language developed for program evolution \cite{spector:2016}. It was designed to be a better language in which to express evolving programs. Autoconstruction was actually one of the driving forces behind the original design. Push can briefly be described as

\begin{quotation}
	a stack based language with a separate stack for each data type [...] Programs are executed by putting them on the \texttt{exec} stack, from which the interpreter continuously takes and processes items \cite{spector:2016}.
\end{quotation}
\todo[inline]{I will hopefully have described enough about stack based languages in Section \ref{sec:sgp} that I won't have to describe much more here}

%When ELSA LOOK AT THIS COMMENT the interpreter sees literals (e.g. integers, strings), it pushes them onto their appropriate stacks and waits for instructions. When the interpreter encounters instructions, it executes them by taking arguments from appropriate stacks and pushing any results onto stacks of the appropriate types \cite{spector:2016}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk about:
	\item how Push = better for autoconstruction things
	\item Plush
	\item linear genomes
	\item how Plush/linear genomes are beneficial to autoconstruciton
	\item PushGP--a "reasonably standard generational genetic programming system"
	\item PUT PUSHGP IN WITH RESULTS STUFF... BRIEFLY MENTION WHAT IT IS (and that it's not autoconstruciton)
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Turn list into paragraphs}

\subsection{AutoDoG}
\label{sec:autodog}
AutoDoG is unique in that is can solve some hard problems. \todo[inline]{stop saying this--you say this in like 4 places... so repetitive} We are going to discuss some of its features, however
\begin{quotation}
	We do not know which of these, or which combinations of these, may be responsible for the fact that AutoDoG appears to be capable of solving more difficult problems than previous autoconstructive evolution systems \cite{spector:2016}.
\end{quotation}
This is because they have not yet studied enough features of AutoDoG to know why it works.

One thing that the designers of AutoDoG wanted to do was maintain diversity in parent selection. To maintain diversity, AutoDoG uses Lexicase Selection. In Lexicase selection,
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each parent selection event starts with pool of entire population
	\item Pool filtered based on performance of individual fitness cases, considered in random order one at a time.
	\item In each case, retains only individuals best on that case.
\end{itemize}

Its name comes from the way it filters the population using a kind of ``lexigraphic ordering" of cases \cite{spector:2016}.
\begin{quotation}
	Lexicase selection performs significantly better than the standard approach and than implicit fitness sharing, allowing the solution of more problems, in fewer generations, on a benchmark suite of problems taken from introductory programming textbooks \cite{spector:2016}.
\end{quotation}
\todo[inline]{will probably paraphrase previous quote since it's so long}

Most autoconstruction systems have some form of the``no cloning rule" which prevents an exact copy of a program from moving on to the next generation, and AutoDoG has a form of this as well \cite{spector:2016}. AutoDoG broadens this to ``require that offspring are only allowed to enter the population if they pass a more stringent diversification test" \cite{spector:2016}.
Test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item make individual for next generation
	\item individual takes itself as mate and makes temp children.
	\item if temp children differ enough from individual and each other, individual enters next generation's population
	\item else, generate new random individual and repeat previous steps
	\item if random individual fails, generate individual with empty genome and add it to next generation
	\item discard any children after test
\end{itemize}

AutoDoG works similarly to PushGP, but is run with autoconstruction as the genetic operator rather than human designed mutation and crossover operators. Its main loop ``iteratively tests the error of all individuals and then builds the next generation by selecting parents and passing them to genetic operators" \cite{spector:2016}.

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Describe more/better, summarize long quotes, turn lists into paragraphs}

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The ``hard problem" we discussed earlier is``Replace Space with Newline." This is a software synthesis problem which, when given a string, requires the solution to print the string replacing spaces with newlines. It also requires the return of the integer count of the non-whitespace characters. This is complex because it involves multiple data types and outputs, and requires conditionals and iteration or recursion.
AutoDoG does not actually do better than standard PushGP on this problem.
\begin{quotation}
	AutoDoG does not succeed as reliably on this problem as has PushGP in some other configurations, but it does solve the problem approximately 5-10 \% of the time, producing general solutions \cite{spector:2016}
\end{quotation}

This is not surprising because AutoDoG has to learn how to evolve as well as learn how to solve the problem. That said, recent (unpublished) results look like there might be scenarios where autoconstruction may find solutions to problems we've never solved with regular PushGP, so we may soon have examples where autoconstruction is `better' in some meaningful sense \cite{Eva:autoconstruction}.
\todo[inline]{FIGURE OUT HOW TO CITE NIC for previous sentence (see Notes from Sources) and/or figure out how to rephrase}

\todo[inline]{More info about new AutoDoG results}

One interesting thing to note is how AutoDoG evolves. In standard PushGP, one can see a steady incline in differences between the genomes of parents and their children. Over time, change occurs at a fairly steady rate and is not very dramatic (from one generation to the next). In AutoDoG, there are huge differences between the genomes of some parents and their children. There was significant change for some individuals from one generation to the next and overall it was a bit erratic.

\end{document}












This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms,
somewhat loosely, to the formatting guidelines for the University of
Minnesota, Morris, Computer Science Senior Seminar proceedings.
It is based heavily on (and takes material directly from) a similar document 
illustrating the format of the ACM SIG Proceedings, which we have based our
proceedings format on.

The original ACM document tried to include
\begin{quote}
	every imaginable sort
	of ``bells and whistles", such as a subtitle, footnotes on
	title, subtitle and authors, as well as in the text, and
	every optional component (e.g. Acknowledgments, Additional
	Authors, Appendices), not to mention examples of
	equations, theorems, tables and figures.\cite{pappa:2014}
\end{quote}

We've removed many of the more esoteric tricks here because either
they'll never be used (e.g., multiple authors) or are used \emph{very}
rarely (e.g., appendices). Refer to the original ACM document for more
of those fancy examples.
% The current paper format *only* allows inline comments using the todo
% macro. That's kind of a bummer, and it would be neat if someone figured
% out how to change the acmconf style to allow this. I suspect it isn't *hard*
% but there are quite a few details that have to be sorted out in synchrony.
\todo[inline]{Needs more work}

The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference, and conference
editors like ACM seek to give their conference by-products a uniform,
high-quality appearance. We also would like our proceedings to look highly
professional, so we're borrowing heavily from the ACM formatting guidelines.
These include some
rigid requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
the page, specified size of margins (2.54cm [1"] top and
bottom and 1.9cm [.75"] left and right; specified column width
(8.45cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.083cm [.33"]).

\todo[inline, color=green]{I really like this section.}

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings,\footnote{One of these, the \texttt{\textbackslash alignauthor} command, 
	you have
	already used; another, \texttt{\textbackslash balancecolumns} will
	be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
	balanced column heights on the last page.} the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands. Section~\ref{sec:body} introduces the main
examples of formatting, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} wraps things up. 

\subsection{My nifty subsection}
\label{sec:mysubsection}

I want to refer to Section~\ref{sec:evocomp}
and Figure~\ref{fig:twoColumnFigure}. It would also be nice
to cite~\cite{spector:2016} and~\cite{pappa:2014} and~\cite{Eva:autoconstruction}.

Let's make an equation:
\[
\textrm{area} = \pi r^2
\]
I want to refer to Section~\ref{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}
and Figure~\ref{fig:twoColumnFigure}. It would also be nice
to cite~\cite{spector:2016}.
We can also do inline equations: $s = \sum_{i=0}^N x_i$.
I want to refer to Section~\ref{sec:typeChangesSpecialChars}
and Figure~\ref{fig:twoColumnFigure}. It would also be nice
to cite~\cite{spector:2016}.\[
s = \sum_{i=0}^N x_i
\]

Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{\textbackslash section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
	starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
	informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
	and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
	how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.


We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{\textbackslash textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{\textbackslash textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{\textbackslash texttt}.
As a rule you'd prefer \texttt{\textbackslash emph} (which stands for \emph{emphasize})
over something like \texttt{\textbackslash textit} since that gives the typesetting system
more flexibility in how it can emphasize that text.

You do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
	Let's make this a rather short one to
	see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
	User's Guide}~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
\label{sec:mathEquations}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\label{sec:inlineEquations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{\textbackslash begin\ldots\textbackslash end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\ldots \$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
\label{sec:displayEquations}

A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation*}

Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:

\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}

and follow it with a numbered equation (Equation~\ref{eq:summation}):

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}

just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.
Note that if you use numbered equations, you can give them \texttt{label}s
and \texttt{\textbackslash ref} them, e.g., Equation~\ref{eq:summation}.

\subsection{Multi-line formulas}
\label{sec:multiLineFormulas}

The \texttt{align} and \texttt{align*} environments let you align sequences of
equations so, for examples, a sequences of equal signs line up nicely. 

% The & creates a "virtual tab stop" and corresponding &'s on each line
% will be aligned when the layout is done.
\begin{align*}
n_1 &= \sum_{i = 1}^k a_i \\
n_{x-y} &= \prod_{i = 1}^k b_i
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
f(x) &= (x+a)(x+b) \\
&= x^2 + (a+b)x + ab
\end{align*}

\subsection{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of
a \textbf{.pdf} file to be displayable with \LaTeX, such as
Figure~\ref{fig:singleColumnFigure}.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\psfig{file=sample_graph.pdf,width =3in}
	\caption{A sample graph just spanning one column.}
	\label{fig:singleColumnFigure}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns, like Figure~\ref{fig:twoColumnFigure}.  
To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\texttt{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
And don't forget to end the environment with
\texttt{figure*}, not \texttt{figure}!

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\psfig{file=sample_graph.pdf,width =5.3in}
	\caption{A sample graph that needs to span two columns of text.}
	\label{fig:twoColumnFigure}
\end{figure*}

It's easiest and you tend to get the best quality if your figure uses vector graphics
in PDF format. You can include other formats such as PNG, but they will usually
not look nearly as professional, especially when printed on high resolution printers.
\emph{Be very wary of screen captures from other papers. They tend to look pixelated
	and amateurish even at high resolutions.}

\subsection{Tables}
\label{sec:tables}

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:frequencyOfSpecialChars} is included in the input file; 
compare the placement of the table here with the table in the
PDF output running \LaTeX\ on this document.

\begin{table}[t]
	\centering
	\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
	\label{tab:frequencyOfSpecialChars}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
		Non-English or Math & Frequency & Comments\\ \hline
		\O & 1 in 1,000 & For Swedish names\\
		$\pi$ & 1 in 5 & Common in math\\
		\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
		$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000 & Unexplained usage\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption, as demonstrated in Table~\ref{tab:typicalCommands} below.  
As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:typicalCommands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}[t]
	\centering
	\caption{Some Typical Commands}
	\label{tab:typicalCommands}
	\begin{tabular}{ccl}
		Command & A Number & Comments \\ \hline
		\texttt{\textbackslash alignauthor}     & 100 & Author alignment\\
		\texttt{\textbackslash numberofauthors} & 200 & Author enumeration\\
		\texttt{\textbackslash table}           & 300 & For tables\\
		\texttt{\textbackslash table*}          & 400 & For wider tables\\ 
	\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Citations}
\label{sec:citations}

Citations to articles~\cite{Aaronson:2005,Garey:1979,Brun:2008} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file~\cite{OM:2008}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

It is recommended that you precede \texttt{\textbackslash cite} (and 
\texttt{\textbackslash ref}) commands with a tilde
character instead of a space, e.g., \texttt{some text\textasciitilde\textbackslash cite}. The tilde gives you a non-breaking space which ensures that your citation won't get
stranded by itself on the beginning of a line.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
	Guide}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{\textbackslash cite},
which is all that is needed for our senior seminar.
You shouldn't use any other forms here.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\label{sec:theoremLikeConstructs}

Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{\textbackslash newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

Theorem~\ref{thm:integration} below uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} command:

% You would usually put a \newtheorem command up at the top 
% of your LaTeX document after the \usepackage commands. It's
% just here in this example so it's with the text that describes it.
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
	an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
	\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
	\label{thm:integration}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
	If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
	unique number which has
	logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
	Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
	\begin{displaymath}
	\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
	\end{displaymath}
	Then
	\begin{align*}
	l &= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) \\
	&= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
	\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ] \\
	&= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
	\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}  \\
	&= 0\cdot L  \\
	&= 0,
	\end{align*}
	which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition~\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{\textbackslash newtheorem} or the
\texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
\label{sec:caveatForExperts}

Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{\textbackslash newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{\textbackslash def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{\textbackslash def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.


This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.

You want to use the \texttt{\textbackslash section*} version of the \texttt{section}
command, as an acknowledgments section typically does \emph{not} get
a number.

It is common (but by no means necessary) for students to thank
