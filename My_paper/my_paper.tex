\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Mostly notes right now}

Traditionally, genetic programming solutions to problems evolve, but almost everything else is specified by the system designer \cite{spector:2016}. In autoconstruction, the variation methods are evolving as well.

In sections~\ref{sec:evocomp},~\ref{sec:GP},~and~\ref{sec:HH} we describe necessary background for understanding the rest of the paper. Next, we describe the history of automating algorithm design (AAD) with a focus on hyper-heuristics (HH) optimization in section~\ref{sec:history}. Then, in section~\ref{sec:gpvariants}, we go over a few different genetic programming variants used in HH and the success of two in particular. Finally, we will go over current research being done with stack-based genetic programming (one of the GP variants) in section~\ref{sec:ac}; the stack-based programming language called Push is used in this example along with a technique for AAD called autoconstruction.
\todo[inline, color=yellow]{this is long roadmap. Probably need to shorten}

\section{Autoconstruction}
\label{sec:ac}
In genetic programming hyper heuristics (GPHH), the goal is to use genetic programming to evolve a program that will solve hard computational search problems. The individual programs serve as potential solutions. In GPHH, only the potential solutions are evolving~--~everything else is specified by the system designer. \todo[inline]{not sure how to phrase previous sentence. Also not sure if I need to clarify what I mean by ``potential solutions"} In autoconstruction, evolution is evolving as well. This happens by encoding the methods of variation into the programs that are evolving so that, as a program evolves, its variation methods also evolve (see section~\ref{sec:push} for how this works).

Prior work on autoconstruction has explored a variety of system designs, but, until recently, none of them have been able to solve hard problems. A new system called Autoconstructive Diversification of Genomes (AutoDoG) has broken this trend by solving at least one hard problem: ``Replace Space with Newline"~\cite{spector:2016}. And, in recent unpublished work, AutoDoG has actually solved a problem that has never been solved before~\cite{eva:2017}.
\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Not sure how much of this is introduction stuff}

\subsection{Push and Plush}
\label{sec:push}

Push is a stack-based programming language with a separate stack for each data type. It was developed for program evolution and autoconstruction was one of the driving forces behind the original design~\cite{spector:2016}. Push programs are strings of instructions, constants, and parentheses with only one syntax requirement: the parentheses must be balanced~\cite{lee:2001}.
\todo[inline]{I am not sure that I should mention prev sentence, because I may want to give examples if this is mentioned...} 
Instructions are executed by putting them on the \texttt{exec} stack. If the necessary arguments are not available for the instruction to be executed, the instruction is skipped. For example, assume all stacks are empty and assume a program says \texttt{(1 2 integer\_add)}. This means push 1 and 2 onto the \texttt{integer} stack and push the \texttt{integer\_add} onto the  take the \texttt{exec} stack~\cite{lee:tutorial}. The \texttt{integer\_add} instruction will try to execute: the first two integers (in this case 1 and 2)  are popped off the top of the \texttt{integer} stack, added together, and the result is pushed back on to the \texttt{integer} stack. If, instead, the program was \texttt{(1 integer\_add)} then it would push 1 onto the \texttt{integer} stack, but skip the \texttt{integer\_add} because there are not enough integers in the \texttt{integer} stack.

	\item PUT PUSHGP IN WITH RESULTS STUFF... BRIEFLY MENTION WHAT IT IS (and that it's not autoconstruciton)
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Turn list into paragraphs}

\subsection{AutoDoG}
\label{sec:autodog}
In this section, we briefly describe some of the key features of AutoDoG.

One thing that the designers of AutoDoG wanted to do was maintain diversity in parent selection. To do this, AutoDoG uses Lexicase Selection, described below:

In each parent selection event,
\begin{itemize}
	\item start with pool of entire population
	\item filter pool based on how each program performs on individual fitness cases (performed in random order, and one at a time)
	\todo[inline]{HOW do I phrase prev bullet point?}
	\item In each fitness case, only retain programs best on that case.
\end{itemize}
\todo[inline, color=green]{TO NIC: is above a correct summary of lexicase selection?}

\todo[inline, color=purple]{left off 10:30 in video, here (ish) in paper}

Its name comes from the way it filters the population using a kind of ``lexigraphic ordering" of cases \cite{spector:2016}.
\begin{quotation}
	Lexicase selection performs significantly better than the standard approach and than implicit fitness sharing, allowing the solution of more problems, in fewer generations, on a benchmark suite of problems taken from introductory programming textbooks \cite{spector:2016}.
\end{quotation}
\todo[inline]{will probably paraphrase previous quote since it's so long}

Most autoconstruction systems have some form of the``no cloning rule" which prevents an exact copy of a program from moving on to the next generation, and AutoDoG has a form of this as well \cite{spector:2016}. AutoDoG broadens this to ``require that offspring are only allowed to enter the population if they pass a more stringent diversification test" \cite{spector:2016}.
Test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item make individual for next generation
	\item individual takes itself as mate and makes temp children.
	\item if temp children differ enough from individual and each other, individual enters next generation's population
	\item else, generate new random individual and repeat previous steps
	\item if random individual fails, generate individual with empty genome and add it to next generation
	\item discard any children after test
\end{itemize}

AutoDoG works similarly to PushGP, but is run with autoconstruction as the genetic operator rather than human designed mutation and crossover operators. Its main loop ``iteratively tests the error of all individuals and then builds the next generation by selecting parents and passing them to genetic operators" \cite{spector:2016}.

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Describe more/better, summarize long quotes, turn lists into paragraphs}

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:results}
AutoDoG is unique among autoconstructive systems in that it can solve hard problems. However, as stated by Spector et al,
\begin{quotation}
	We do not know which of these, or which combinations of these, may be responsible for the fact that AutoDoG appears to be capable of solving more difficult problems than previous autoconstructive evolution systems \cite{spector:2016}.
\end{quotation}
This is because it's hard to separate the pieces; there are a lot of intertwined elements of AutoDoG and Push. Separating them to find which elements contribute to the success without unraveling the entire system is difficult and has not yet been done.
\todo[inline, color=green]{TO NIC: Is this (above) more correct?}

The ``hard problem" we mentioned earlier is ``Replace Space with Newline." This is a software synthesis problem which, when given a string, requires the solution to print the string replacing spaces with newlines. It also requires the return of the integer count of the non-whitespace characters. This is complex because it involves multiple data types and outputs, and requires conditionals and iteration or recursion.
AutoDoG does not actually do better than standard PushGP on this problem.
\begin{quotation}
	AutoDoG does not succeed as reliably on this problem as has PushGP in some other configurations, but it does solve the problem approximately 5-10 \% of the time, producing general solutions \cite{spector:2016}
\end{quotation}

``This is not surprising because AutoDoG has to learn how to evolve as well as learn how to solve the problem. That said, recent (unpublished) results look like there might be scenarios where autoconstruction may find solutions to problems we've never solved with regular PushGP, so we may soon have examples where autoconstruction is `better' in some meaningful sense" \todo[inline]{PARAPHRASE QUOTE FROM NIC}

\todo[inline]{More info about new AutoDoG results}

One interesting thing to note is how AutoDoG evolves. In standard PushGP, one can see a steady incline in differences between the genomes of parents and their children. Over time, change occurs at a fairly steady rate and is not very dramatic (from one generation to the next). In AutoDoG, there are huge differences between the genomes of some parents and their children. There was significant change for some individuals from one generation to the next and overall it was a bit erratic.

Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{\textbackslash section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
	starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
	informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
	and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
	how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.
